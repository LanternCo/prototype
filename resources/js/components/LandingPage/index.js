                        We’ve been there. Our team started in your shoes having
                        lost parents and grandparents, and having been totally
                        overwhelmed by all of the work that came with it. We
                        quickly realized it’s really hard to navigate not only
                        the first few days but also the weeks and months
                        following a loss. So, we made it our mission to ensure
                        every grieving person has a simple, trustworthy, and
                        comprehensive place to turn. We’ve sifted through the
                        hundreds of websites, funeral services, and books so you
                        don’t have to and we’ve got some of the most
                        knowledgeable people in the game advising us. Think of
                        us as part knowledgeable friend who’s been there before
                        and part assistant to help you wade through the tough
                        stuff.
